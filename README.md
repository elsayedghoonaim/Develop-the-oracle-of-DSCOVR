Project Name: Solar Wind Data Analysis
Description:
This project involves the analysis of solar wind data using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains various parameters related to solar wind measurements, such as IMF (Interplanetary Magnetic Field), PLS (Plasma), ABS_B (Absolute Magnetic Field), and many more.

The main objective of this project is to predict the KP index, which is a measure of geomagnetic activity. The KP index is influenced by various factors, including solar wind parameters. By analyzing the correlation between the KP index and other parameters, we can build a machine learning model to predict the KP index based on the given parameters.

Files:
